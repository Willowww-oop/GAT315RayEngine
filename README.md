Welcome to my Physics Simulator where you will be able to create bodies that will react differently with physics

The only thing that you'd need to do is download the zip file and then start the program once you've opened it up in visual studio

Some of the things that are in this simulator are:

World Gravity; you can change how all of the bodies will react

Size and Mass; you can change the size and mass of the bodies

Gravitation; bodies with more mass will attract other objects to go towards it

Dynamic, Kinematic, and Static bodies; you'll be able to pick what kind of type the bodies will be

Springs and Spring Stiffness; connect the bodies with strings that'll react depending on the stiffness, with it either being extra stretchy or will have them collapse

Additionally the bodies are using AABB collision detection, so they will not intersect eachother and will stay in the aspect ratio of the screen

There's a simulate button that'll let you pause the time so that you can place dynamic bodies without them being affected by gravity

The only controls are left click to change values and add bodies, SPACE to enable and disable simulate, Right Click to add springs to a body, Right Clicking and hold Left CTRL to drag the body, and E to delete all bodies

Here's the GUI:
